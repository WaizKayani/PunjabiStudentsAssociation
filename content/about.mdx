  title: 'About PSA',

We are the **Punjabi Students Association (PSA)** at The Ohio State University — a community celebrating Punjabi culture, language, music, dance, food, and history across the Punjabi diaspora.

## What is Punjab?

Punjab (literally “land of five rivers”) is a historical region spanning present‑day Indian Punjab and Pakistani Punjab. Fertile plains, wheat and mustard fields, and a vibrant agrarian life shape Punjabi identity. Punjabi is among the world’s most‑spoken languages and is written in two primary scripts: **Gurmukhi** (primarily in India) and **Shahmukhi** (Perso‑Arabic script, used in Pakistan).

## Culture at a glance

- **Dance**: Energetic **Bhangra** and expressive **Giddha**.
- **Music & instruments**: The heartbeat **dhol**, melodic **tumbi** and **algoza**, and lyrical folk traditions.
- **Cuisine**: Comforts like **sarson da saag & makki di roti**, **lassi**, **chole bhature**, **parathas**, and sweets like **jalebi** and **gulab jamun**.
- **Textiles**: **Phulkari** embroidery and leather **jutti**.
- **Festivals**: **Vaisakhi** (harvest and Khalsa founding), **Lohri**, **Basant**, and **Gurpurabs**.
- **Sport**: **Kabaddi** — strength, speed, and strategy.

## History — a very short timeline

- Ancient roots in the Indus valley region; a crossroads of trade and ideas.
- Flourishing of Sikh history and the Sikh Empire under Maharaja Ranjit Singh (19th century).
- 1947 Partition split the region between India and Pakistan — a pivotal moment for Punjabi communities.
- Post‑Partition diaspora: Punjabis helped shape global culture across the UK, North America, and beyond.

## Our Mission at OSU

We bring together Indian and Pakistani Punjabis — and anyone who loves Punjabi culture — to build community, bridge divides, and showcase the arts, stories, and traditions of Punjab through events, performances, food, and collaborations across campus.
